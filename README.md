# access-bc

This repository contains the script for the [AccessBC](https://bcdigschol.github.io/accessbc/) interactive webmap application of the Boston College Campuses.

This project is a collaborative project between the [BC Digital Scholarship Group](https://ds.bc.edu/), colleagues in Facilities, and feedback from BC's Council for Students with Disabilites. The purpose of this webmap is to make resources around the BC campuses more visible and findable as well as try to help users navigate campus.
